        <p>Its been 2 years since the outbreak. Most of the population are now the walking corpses we call undead. Some have chosen the path of violence to get what they need. You have been part of a small community that has been doing farely well. Sadly it's that time again to gather supplies. Last time you got lucky, lets see if you can make it back and save your community.</p>
